# FunimationBingeWatchHelper

Hopefully this will save people some time. 

You can change the amount of time that is skipped in the intro and the time when the next episode is started. 

Bonus treat is that I also found out you can remove the logo. 

**7-13-2020 now includes a feature to skip youtube ads automatically as well -- might decouple the two features in the future**

**8-16-2020 decoupled the two features. added extra options. made fullscreen work as well as it can in funimation. added ability to turn off the each of the skippers (youtube/funimation)**

Feel free to add on and pull request. This is super bare bones and could be extended to a few other websites.
