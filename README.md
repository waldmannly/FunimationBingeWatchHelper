# FunimationBingeWatchHelper

Hopefully this will save people some time. 

You can change the amount of time that is skipped in the intro and the time when the next episode is started. 

Bonus treat is that I also found out you can remove the logo. 

**7-13-2020 now include a feature to skip youtube adds automatically as well -- might decouple the two features in the future**

Feel free to add on and pull request. This is super bare bones and could be extended to a few other websites.
